# Doing Geospatial in Python

See Workshop entry doc https://geopython.github.io/geopython-workshop.

## Installation

### Requirements

The workshop requires [Docker](https://docker.com)
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) on your system

### Docker Images

The Docker Images for this workshop are [available on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/geopython/geopython-workshop).
The name of the workshop Image is `geopython/geopython-workshop[:latest]`.
Note that the Docker Images contain mainly all (Python) components/dependencies. The actual workshop content (data+notebooks) will be
Docker-Volume-mounted. There is no need to build the Docker Image yourself (see below), except for testing and development.

## Running

All services are started using a [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/geopython/geopython-workshop/blob/master/workshop/docker-compose.yml).

Windows users; use [powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) or [Linux Subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) to run below commands.

```bash
cd workshop
# start workshop
./geopython-workshop-ctl.sh start
# display URL and open in default web browser, if a browser does not open, then copy the url from the command output to your browser.
./geopython-workshop-ctl.sh url

# NB Possibly best if we add a frontend or use docs ("home") as entrypoint
./geopython-workshop-ctl.sh stop
```

NB [Jupyter notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) needs a **token**. The token is displayed in the jupyter container logs on startup:

`http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<longtokenhexstring>`.

As Docker Compose may run in background you can make logging
output visible via `docker logs --follow geopython-workshop-jupyter`. Or 
in Docker Desktop UI, select the jupyter container to see its logs.
 
### Building

You may always build a Docker Image from this repo yourself, e.g. for bugfixing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geopython/geopython-workshop.git
cd geopython-workshop.git/workshop/jupyter
./build.sh
```

### Notes

- Docker must be managed by non-root users in linux. Please make sure to perform the following [post-installation step](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
- by default the web services pygeoapi and pycsw are not required for the regular workshop like FOSS4G
- if you use pygeoapi: there is an issue with MacOS Monterey where the port 5000 is already used and therefore conflicting with that one used by pygeoapi. If you are facing this error `OSError: [Errno 48] Address already in use` then your machine is affected. To overcome the issue you can disable the *Airplay Receiver* from `System Preferences->Sharing` of your MacOS (detailed description in this blog [post](https://progressstory.com/tech/port-5000-already-in-use-macos-monterey-issue/)).
